🔎 Step-by-Step Process
1️⃣ Data Loading & Cleaning
Loaded dataset from /data/cinema_hall_ticket_sales.csv

Replaced "Alone" with 1 in Number_of_Person

Converted Purchase_Again from "Yes"/"No" to 1/0

2️⃣ Quick Data Overview
Used data.info() and data.describe() to understand data types, missing values, and basic statistics.

3️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Generated the following visualizations:


Visualization	File Path
Age Distribution	/visuals/age_distribution.png
Ticket Price by Seat Type	/visuals/ticket_price_seat_type.png
Movie Genre Popularity	/visuals/genre_popularity.png
Repeat Purchase Rate by Age Group	/visuals/repeat_purchase_age_group.png
Correlation Matrix	/visuals/correlation_matrix.png
All charts can also be viewed interactively in notebooks/eda_analysis.ipynb.

4️⃣ Hypothesis Testing
Hypothesis 1:
Older audiences (>40) prefer premium seating and higher-priced tickets.

Test: Chi-Square Test

Result: p-value = 0.3314 → No significant relationship

Hypothesis 2:
Younger audiences (18-35) visit more frequently.

Test: Independent T-Test on Purchase_Again

Result: p-value = 0.4218 → No significant difference

Detailed code and outputs are available in notebooks/eda_analysis.ipynb.

5️⃣ Output Files
Cleaned dataset saved as:
data/cleaned_cinema_data.csv

Visualizations stored in:
/visuals/

📊 Key Findings
No statistically significant evidence for the proposed hypotheses.

VIP and Premium seats are associated with higher ticket prices but not strongly linked to age >40.

Genre Popularity: Comedy and Drama are the most watched genres.

Repeat Purchases: Highest among the 36-50 age group, not necessarily the youngest audience.

🚧 Limitations & Future Work
The dataset does not include external factors like:

Movie ratings

Date/time of visits

Promotional offers

Future improvements:

Enrich data with seasonal patterns or customer feedback

Apply Machine Learning (next project phase) to predict customer retention (Purchase_Again)
