Older audiences which are bigger than 40 prefer Premium seating and higher‐priced tickets
After binarizing data['Older'] = data['Age'] > 40, you run a chi-square test on the contingency table of Older vs. “Seat_Type == 'Premium'”
That directly tests whether the over-40 group disproportionately chooses Premium seats (and, by extension, pays higher prices in those seats).
